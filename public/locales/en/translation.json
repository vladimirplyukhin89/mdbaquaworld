  "questions_3": "What are the main differences between the two versions?",
  "questions_answer": "Our water purification stations are designed to receive and purify natural groundwater, surface water of varying degrees of contamination to drinking water quality standards or other requirements",
  "questions_answer_2": "A distinctive feature of frame-modular stations is the absence of a block-modular building, and the units themselves are mounted on a frame with the possibility of modular assembly. Such stations are mounted in a finished room, with connection to a collector of source, purified and drainage water, as well as to a power point",
  "questions_answer_3": "Block-modular stations do not require the construction of special structures, which significantly reduces the cost of design and construction work in the construction of water treatment complexes. Stations are assembled on the basis of metal structures with sandwich panels according to the dimensions of standard transportable blocks. The design of the stations can be adapted to work both in hot climates and in the conditions of the Far North. All container stations comply with fire safety standards and are vandal-proof. They can also be supplemented with a separate tank with a system for storing and distributing clean water",
